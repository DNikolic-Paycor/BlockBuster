App where you can add, delete , search,sort and post comments about yours favorite movies.  
Builted with React JS  
Curently you can only try it localy because gh-pages dont suport react-router  

To run on local maschine:  
clone or download  
cd BlockBuster
npm install
npm start  

ToDo:  
Fix some CSS,  
Comments work on front-end localy, they are not posted to database 
When on single movie page and reload ,component dont recieve props from parent
